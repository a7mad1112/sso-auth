# Node.js Authentication with Passport and Google OAuth

This repository contains a simple Node.js web application demonstrating user authentication using Passport.js with Google OAuth. The application is built on the Express framework and utilizes Passport to authenticate users through their Google accounts. Users can log in via the Google authentication flow and view their profile information, including name, email, and profile picture. The project includes a basic structure for handling sessions, redirects, and user logout. The code showcases how to integrate Google OAuth authentication into a Node.js application and provides a foundation for building more advanced features on top of this authentication system.
